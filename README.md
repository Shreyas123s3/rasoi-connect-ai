## 🚀 Problem Statement

> **Street food vendors in India struggle with inconsistent access to quality raw materials at fair prices.**  
> Middlemen exploit them. Prices are unpredictable. Trusted suppliers are hard to find.  
> Most of these vendors are not digitally empowered — resulting in daily struggles to manage cost, quality, and supply.
